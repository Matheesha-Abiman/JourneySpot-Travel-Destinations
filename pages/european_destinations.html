                        it a perfect
                        destination for a weekend break from the UK. The city is known for its design, food, and

                        evident in its bike-friendly streets and eco-conscious initiatives.
                        The city’s culinary scene is a highlight, with Michelin-starred restaurants like Noma, as well
                        as
                        casual eateries serving open-faced sandwiches (smørrebrød) and Danish pastries. Copenhagen is
                        also
                        known for its innovative design, and visitors can explore its many galleries, boutiques, and
                        design
                        shops. The city’s relaxed vibe, combined with its rich history and modern appeal, makes it an
                        ideal
